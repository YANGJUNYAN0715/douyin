# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "dev_fjz","zhao","main","guo" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Go environment
        uses: actions/setup-go@v3.5.0
        # with:
        # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use. Supports semver spec and ranges.
          # go-version: # optional
          # Path to the go.mod or go.work file.
          # go-version-file: # optional
          # Set this option to true if you want the action to always check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
          # check-latest: # optional
          # Used to pull node distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
          # token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: build
        run: |
          cd cmd/comment && ./build.sh
          cd cmd/user && ./build.sh
